# Systematic Theory of Personhood

## Overview

This repository contains a **formal and conceptual framework** for understanding **personhood** across philosophical, legal, cultural, and applied contexts.
The theory is expressed in **LaTeX**, making it suitable for academic publication, and organizes the concept of personhood into **ten core dimensions** that can be analyzed systematically.

## Motivation

The concept of **personhood** has been central to debates in philosophy, ethics, and law for centuries — from Aristotle’s rational animal to Locke’s consciousness-based identity, from Kant’s moral autonomy to modern human rights discourse, AI ethics, and indigenous cosmologies.
This project offers:

* A **taxonomy** for comparing theories of personhood.
* A **structured approach** that integrates metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, law, and socio-cultural perspectives.
* A **formal model** that can be extended for computational reasoning.

## Features

* **Ten Dimensions of Personhood**: Ontology, Attributes, Temporal Continuity, Agency, Rights, Recognition, Moral Status, Social Embedding, Epistemology, and Transformations.
* **Cross-Disciplinary Reach**: Philosophy, law, anthropology, cognitive science, and AI ethics.
* **Formal Representation**: Uses LaTeX for precision and scholarly readability.
* **Customizable**: Framework is modular — adapt dimensions, add definitions, extend with modal or deontic logic.
